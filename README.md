# bin
A paste bin with an SQLite database.

A paste bin that's actually minimalist. No database requirement (because we use SQLite), no commenting functionality, no self-destructing or time bomb messages and no social media integrationâ€”just an application to quickly send snippets of text to people.

Allows you to Ctrl+A without selecting anything but the paste.

##### How to build

Compile it from source using `cargo build --release`. Get cargo at https://rustup.rs.

##### How to run

```bash
$ ./bin
```

##### How does syntax highlighting work?

To get syntax highlighting you need to add the file extension at the end of your paste URL.
